                   <p class="info"> Growing up my Mother would cook for family gatherings. She would prepare
                    meals for Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's, birthday parties, church functions, and  many other events. My Mother even catered my wedding reception, and the food was delicious.
                    Our family migrated from the deep south. They travelled from Arkansas and Lousiana to San Francisco. My Mother learned how to cook from her Mother and Grandmother on how to cook and to use spices in recipes. 
                    She would cook different types of American Cusines. My Mother can cook Louisana Creole Cuisine, Soul Food, Gullah-Geechee Cusine, and other ethnic cuisines. I will share some of my family favorite recipes  </p>

            <div class="p-2">Soul Food
        
            <p class="text-justify">Soul food is an ethnic cuisine traditionally prepared and eaten by African Americans, originating in the Southern United
            States. The cuisine originated with the foods that were given to enslaved West Africans on southern plantations during
            the American colonial period; however, it was strongly influenced by the traditional practices of West Africans and
            Native Americans from its inception. Due to the historical presence of African Americans in the region, soul food is
            closely associated with the cuisine of the American South although today it has become an easily-identifiable and
            celebrated aspect of mainstream American food culture.</p>

            <div class="p-2">Creole Cusine
            
             <p class="text-justify">Louisiana Creole cuisine (French: Cuisine créole, Spanish: Cocina criolla) is a style of cooking originating in
            Louisiana, United States, which blends West African, French, Spanish, Amerindian influences, as well as influences from
            the general cuisine of the Southern United States.
            Creole cuisine revolves around influences found in Louisiana from populations present in Louisiana before the sale of
            Louisiana to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.</p>

            <div class="p-2">Gullah-Geechee Cuisine
                <p class="text-justify" >“Gullah-Geechee cuisine is one of the original foods of the world.” Okra, grains, and 
                    seafood are among the key ingredients of Gullah-Geechee cuisine. They’re used in staple
                     dishes like okra soup, which resembles a New Orleans gumbo but is made with a tomato base
                      instead of a roux, along with lima beans, bacon, shrimp, and garlic, among other
                       ingredients.</p>
