# Family-Cusine-Recipes-

This repo is for my Code Louisville Project. 

My project is about my family favorite recipes and information about Soul Food, Creole, and Gullah/Geechee
cuisine. This project will have information about my family history with cooking and recipes for visitors to 
try. The recipes will consist of my favorite main dishes, side dishes, and desserts. I will also 
provide information on where you could purchase spices utilized to create the cuisine. 



I created a for loop to display javascript on the page.
