# Family-Cusine-Recipes-

This repo is for my Code Louisville Project. 

My project is about my family history with cooking and history about Soul Food, Creole, and Gullah/Geechee
cuisine. The website will display information about my family's cooking background, and recipes for visitors
to try. The recipes will consist of easy main dishes, side dishes, and desserts. My website will link you to
another website where you could purchase spices to make the recipes or to incorporate into your own recipes. 
You would need to click on the favorite button to get to the website. My website would also ask visitors to 
participate in a poll vote and to try the recipes. 



CSS was use to create a navigation in the header. I added links to the navigation buttons. When you click on 
the buttons, you will be directed to the proper place on the website. The favorites button would link you to
https://www.thespicehouse.com/. The back to top link was added to the bottom of the webpage. 
In addition, The nav header collapses properly and changes from vertical to horizontal when scaling up media 
queries. The media queries used are min-width 320px to 600px, min-width 800px, and 1200px. Col and Col-1
changes from stack to columns when scaling up media queries. Flexbox was utilized for a responsive website. 
The nth-child was added to styles.css to highlight the text in column-1. 

I created a function in javascript for users to participate in the poll vote. The alert method was added,
to display a message for each cuisine button when clicked. I added the addeventlistener to the function, so
when vistors click on the button it would display the cuisine vote. The localStorage was added to the function
to show how many times visitors voted for a specific cuisine. Javascript was use to create an array to display
cuisine history, recipes, and images. I created a for loop to display it on the website. Animation was added
to the border and images of class "col." 

Below is the link to my github pages that shows how my website runs.
