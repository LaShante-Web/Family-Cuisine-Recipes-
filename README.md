# Family-Cusine-Recipes-

This repo is for my Code Louisville Project. 

My project is about my family favorite recipes and information about Soul Food, Creole, and Gullah/Geechee
cuisine. This website will display information about my family history, cooking and recipes for visitors to 
try. The recipes will consist of my favorite main dishes, side dishes, and desserts. I will also 
provide information on where you could purchase spices. 



CSS was use to create a navigation in the header. The navigation collapses properly and changes from horizontal 
to vertical when scaling down media queries. I utilize flexbox for a responsive website, and to swap columns
based on media query. I added the nth-child to highlight the text in column-1. I created a function in 
javascript for users to participate in the poll vote. I added localStorage to the function to show how many
times visitors voted for a specific cuisine. I create an alert to display for each cuisine when clicked
Javascript was use to create an array to display cuisine history, recipes, and images. I created a for loop to
display it on the website. Animation was added to the history border and images.
