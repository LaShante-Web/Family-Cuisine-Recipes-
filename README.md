# Family-Cusine-Recipes-

This repo is for my Code Louisville Project. 

My project is about my family history with cooking and history about Soul Food, Creole, and Gullah/Geechee
cuisine. The website will display information about my family's cooking background, and recipes for visitors to 
try. The recipes will consist of easy main dishes, side dishes, and desserts. I will also 
provide information on where you could purchase spices. The website would also ask visitors to participate in a 
poll vote.



CSS was use to create a navigation in the header. I added links to the navigation buttions. When you click on 
the button, you would be directed to the proper place on the website. In addition, I created a link to another 
website. The navigation collapses properly and changes from vertical to horizontal when scaling up media
queries. The media queries used are min-width 320px, min-width 800px, and 
1200px. Col and Col-1 changes from stack to columns when scaling up media queries. Flexbox was utilized for a
responsive website. The nth-child was added to styles.css to highlight the text in column-1. I created a
function in javascript for users to participate in the poll vote. I added the 
addeventlistener to the function, so when vistors click on the button it would display the cuisine 
vote. The localStorage was add to the function to show how many times visitors voted for a specific cuisine. The
alert method was added to display a message for each cuisine when clicked. Javascript was use to create an 
array to display cuisine history, recipes, and images. I created a for loop to display it on the website.
Animation was added to the border and images of class "col."
